# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

# 1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.
  python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility. Key features that make Python popular among developers include:

Ease of Learning and Use: Simple and clean syntax.
Versatility: Suitable for web development, data analysis, machine learning, automation, and more.
Extensive Libraries: Rich standard library and a vast ecosystem of third-party packages.
Use cases: Web applications (Django, Flask), data analysis (Pandas, NumPy), machine learning (TensorFlow, scikit-learn), and scripting.

# 2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
     ## Steps to install Python on Windows:

Download: Go to the official Python website (https://www.python.org) and download the latest version for Windows.
Install: Run the installer. Ensure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
Verify: Open Command Prompt and type python --version to verify the installation.
Virtual Environment: Create a virtual environment using python -m venv myenv.

## Steps to install Python on macOS/Linux:

macOS: Use Homebrew (brew install python).
Linux: Use the package manager (e.g., sudo apt-get install python3).
Verify: Open Terminal and type python3 --version.
Virtual Environment: Create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv myenv.

# 3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
   - Simple Python Program:

## python code
print("Hello, World!")
Explanation:

print is a built-in function that outputs text to the console.
"Hello, World!" is a string, a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.

# 4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
   - Basic Data Types in Python:

int: Integer numbers (42)
float: Floating-point numbers (3.14)
str: Strings ("Hello")
bool: Boolean values (True, False)
list: Ordered collection ([1, 2, 3])
dict: Key-value pairs ({"key": "value"})
Script Demonstrating Data Types:

## python code
age = 30
height = 5.9
name = "Alice"
is_student = True
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

print(age, height, name, is_student, numbers, person)

# 5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
   - Conditional Statements:

## python code
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")
Loops:

## python code
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# 6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
   - Function Definition and Use:

## python code
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(3, 5)
print(result)
Explanation:

def keyword defines a function.
a and b are parameters.
return statement returns the sum of a and b.

# 7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
   - Lists vs. Dictionaries:

List: Ordered, indexed collection. Mutable.
Dictionary: Unordered collection of key-value pairs. Mutable.
Script:

## python code
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
info = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

## List operations
numbers.append(6)
print(numbers)

## Dictionary operations
info["email"] = "alice@example.com"
print(info)

# 8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
   - Example of Exception Handling:

## python code
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
finally:
    print("This block always executes")
Explanation:

try block contains code that might raise an exception.
except block handles the exception.
finally block executes regardless of an exception.

# 9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
   - Modules and Packages:

Module: A single Python file containing functions and definitions.
Package: A collection of modules in a directory with an __init__.py file.
Using a Module:

## python code
import math

print(math.sqrt(16))


# 10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
    - Reading from a File:

## python code
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
Writing to a File:

## python code
lines = ["First line", "Second line", "Third line"]
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    for line in lines:
        file.write(line + '\n')

# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
